# hello-relworld-
my world!
to be or not to be
yang and beautiful
l have seen the world
done it all had my cake now
diamonds brilliant and bel-air now
hot summer nights mid july
when you and I were forever wild
the crazy days the city lights
the way you had play with me like a child!
sorry for borning as human!
